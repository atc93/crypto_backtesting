# pex

This is a Jupyter notebook cryptocurrency backtesting tool. Its name pex stems from **p**seudo-**ex**periment.

This tool is two fold: a backtesting part, and an analysis of the backtesting results part. As common with Jupyter notebooks,
the notebooks are filled with comments in the hope of making the notebooks self-explanatory.

The required modules are listed in requirements.txt.
